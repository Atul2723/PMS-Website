                            <p><MdArrowCircleRight className='desc-icon'/> In 2012, the NSE and BSE collectively opened two exchanges for the listing of SME IPOs. These are: 
                            <ol>
                                <li>BSE SME platform by the Bombay Stock Exchange</li>
                                <li>NSE EMERGE by the National Stock Exchange</li>
                                
                                </ol></p>
                            <p><MdArrowCircleRight className='desc-icon'/> Just like any other company issues an IPO to raise funds, SME IPOs are meant to raise capital for a small and medium enterprise company. As SMEs are smaller than other companies, the SME IPO is smaller in issue size than a regular companyâ€™s IPO. After raising capital through an IPO, the shares trade on the SME exchange. </p>
